            <p>Hello! I'm Yang Wenhao, an international student from Zhejiang Province, China. I graduated in the summer of 2024 with a degree in Digital Media Technology from Anhui University.</p>
            
            <p>My undergraduate program was a joint degree between Anhui University and Stony Brook University in the U.S., specializing in Information Management. This gave me the opportunity to experience bilingual instruction, which will help me adapt well to the British education system here at UCL. I have a strong background in programming, primarily focused on software development, and a keen interest in exploring new technologies.</p>
            
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy fitness, playing computer games, and singing. Whether I'm hitting the gym or belting out my favorite tunes, these activities help me unwind and recharge. I have also participated in University Singing Competitions, which have greatly improved my confidence and performance skills. I hope to successfully and happily complete my studies while collaborating and progressing with all my teachers and classmates,I hope to successfully and happily complete my studies while collaborating and progressing with all my teachers and classmates, contributing to a dynamic learning environment at UCL.</p>
